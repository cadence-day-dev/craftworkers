There is a growing urgency to understand the environmental cost of what already exists. Regulation and taxation on embodied carbon are turning old buildings into new liabilities.

CRAFT addresses this. We provide a fast, cost-effective LCA service for large property portfolios banks, pension funds, and institutions that must now account for carbon as carefully as capital.

Using computational design, we reconstruct each building as a simplified geometry and run simulations that deliver an 80% accurate LCA, at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional methods.

It’s a pragmatic and economoically efficient approach, precise enough to guide decisions, light enough to scale.

We make the invisible impact of the built environment visible and actionable.
